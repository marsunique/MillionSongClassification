## Instruction
### Naive Bayes (without library)
The data this model use are the `train_sample.csv` and `test_sample.csv` in this folder. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0UQJ5SM5N6gZ1lSaWxTODE5Y0E) to the data on Google drive.

This Naive Bayes method is implemented in Python 2.7 without using any 3rd-part packages. We write this algorithm from cratch.

There are two '.py' files here, using different strategies to handle the missing value problem respectively. More detailed information will be included in the final report.

To run the code, run command `python naive_bayes.py`. Classification result will show up after the runninig.
