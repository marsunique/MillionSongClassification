## Preprocessing

`topSongs.txt` - Top song data.

The `JsonToCSV(millionsong).py` is the script used to create .csv data file. Basically, it reads the data records from the [original json format data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0UQJ5SM5N6gbWRlV1RMUUNIQVU?usp=sharing), and tries to match the records in the `topSongs.txt`. The result .csv file is `millionSongs(labeled).csv` located in the [`Train&test data`](https://github.ncsu.edu/ysun34/CSC522_MillionSongClassification/tree/master/Train%26test%20data) folder.
