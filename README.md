## Instruction
### Naive Bayes (without library)
The data this model use are the `train_sample.csv` and `test_sample.csv` under the [`Data(Algorithm-Million Song Classification/Training and Test Data/`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0UQJ5SM5N6gZ1lSaWxTODE5Y0E) directory on our Google drive . 

To run the code, go to folder `/naive_bayes_no_lib/` in the repository. The traning data and test data are already there. 

Run command `python naive_bayes.py`. Classification result will show up after the runninig.

## Overview

Language(s) we are using 
We will be using Python mostly.

Goal
Our goal is to classify songs with the focus of predicting if a song will make it to the top 100

Question(s) to Answer
3 easy questions to validate our setup
- 	Can we parse the .h5 files?
- 	Can we pick out the parts that we think will help us out the most?
- 	Can we attach song success to the already existing songs?

2-6 medium questions we know we can do
Build a classification model
Cluster the songs
-	Instructions for how to write a hit song
- 	Show the trends of popular music

2-3 stretch goals that we may not even finish, but would be awesome if we did
Calculate the genre of a song (Rock, Pop, Country, etc) based on data points
Predict the number of weeks a song will be on the top 40
Recommender system for a user (based on userâ€™s favorite genres, artists)



Plan - What Will We Use To Answer Questions

Preprocessing
We will most likely use Java to parse the .h5 files since it has a built-in functionality to parse the .h5 formats.  We will most likely remove the unstructured data, and export our results as JSON or .csv files.

Classification Algorithms (if any)
Convolutional neural network with TensorFlow, other algorithms we learn in class

Outlier Detectors (if any)
Principal components analysis

Postprocessing
Use data visualization techniques to display the result more interactively

# Things have been done:

Parsing h5 file.

Preliminary selection of attributes (could be refined in the future, maybe more attributes will be incorporated).

Fix encoding problem. Transferred all characters to utf-8 format to avoid unexpected errors.

Done producing workable data (in .csv file).

# Things under processing:

Normalize the data.

Building classifier based on appropriate algorithms.
- 	Linear Regression
- 	L1 Penalized Linear Regression
- 	K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
Compare the performance between different algorithms.

Loading the data into mySQL.

Creating a labeled data set.

# Things to be done:

Generate hottness label in trainning data by using additional database (Billboard?).
Predict hottness of a song.

Optional: 
- 	Sentiment analysis based lyrics. 
- 	Explore themes and meanings of songs and incorporate these features into the dataset.


## Progress Report ##
Andrew - Have implemented Naive Bayes classifier and two outlier detection methods: a Support Vector Machine and a Random Forest.  Currently looking for outliers and trying to interpret the results of the detection methods.  For NB, next step is to see if some variables are easier to predict, and once we have Top 40 dataset, seeing if NB will predict song success.

Dustin - Created the parser for the .h5 files.  Parsed a subset of 10,000 songs into JSON format to be read by Yuchen's filters.  Currently creating a master history list of songs that reached the top 40 charts to be used as a starting point for our labeled data set.  Upon completion, we will extract the song data from the SQL database of all the songs that Marc will create.

Marc - Uploading and formatting data into a mySQL database for easy use. Will use in conjunction with Dustin's list of top 40 history to classify new songs as top 40 or not.

Yuchen - Worked together with Dustin on providing workable input data. Resolved the possible issue caused by the incompatible encoding setup. Will be looking for practicable solution for clustering problem (algorithms, attributes taken into account to do clustering) and how to interpret the clustering result. Also will be doing research on how to present the result (visualization).

Fuxing - Will Generate hottness label in trainning data by using additional database (Billboard). Will use package "Party" in R to classify.

Guanxu - Will implemente Gaussian discriminant model(GDA) classifier to predict the hottness of songs and compare the result come from other teamates' prediction. Will convert nominal attributes(artists, release) into numeric for easy use of classification.
