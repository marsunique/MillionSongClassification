Two ways to implement decision tree.

1, Using Package "Party" in R.

2, Using Sklearn in python.


Python part:

The data this model use are the `train_sample.csv` and `test_sample.csv` under the [`Data(Algorithm-Million Song Classification/Training and Test Data/`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0UQJ5SM5N6gZ1lSaWxTODE5Y0E) directory on our Google drive . 

To run the code, go to folder `/Decision Tree Classification/` in the repository. The traning data and test data are already there. 

Run command `python decision_tree.py`. Classification result will show up after the running.

R part:

Also, The data this model use are the `train_sample.csv` and `test_sample.csv` under the [`Data(Algorithm-Million Song Classification/Training and Test Data/`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0UQJ5SM5N6gZ1lSaWxTODE5Y0E) directory on our Google drive . 

To run the code, go to folder `/Decision Tree Classification/` in the repository. The traning data and test data are already there. 

You need to open file 'party_decision_tree.r' and set the working directory to where it contains the training and testing dataset, after running all the code, the results (precision, recall and fmessure) for three different cases will show on the command lines.
