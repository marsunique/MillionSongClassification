### kNN_R
`millionSongs(labeled)_noNaN.csv` is the data. Line 8 of knn_Music.R must be updated to show the location of the file. Run the file in an R environment. It should take approximately 5-10 minutes to load the data and complete the library implementation. It shouldn't complete the myKNN function because it has yet to complete on my computer after two weeks.
